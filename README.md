Machine Learning Lab 03: Classification Models

This repository contains the implementation for Lab Session 03, focusing on k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Matrix Inversion classification techniques.

Assignment Details

Subject: 22AIE213

Lab Session: 03

Focus: Classification Models (k-NN vs. Matrix Inversion)

Implementation Features

The assignment_3.py script includes modular functions for:

Vector Operations: Custom Dot product and Euclidean Norm (A1).

Statistics: Custom Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation (A2).

Visualization: Histograms (A3) and Minkowski Distance plots (A4).

Classification: - k-NN Classifier (Custom implementation vs. Scikit-Learn) (A7-A11).

Matrix Inversion Classifier (Normal Equation) (A14).

Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix (A12-A13).

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
